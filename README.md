# flask-app
Webapp using Flask and React to calculate the percentage of an inputted number relative to a random number fetched from a database.


## Booting

  * Start a cmd window in the server directory
  * Run `pipenv shell`
  * Run `pipenv update`
  * Run `python app.py`

Server should be up on port 5000.

 * Navigate to UI directory and start a cmd instance
 * Run `npm install`
 * Run `npm run start` 

Flask's cmd instance sometimes lags after booting, if the first time you press generate nothing happens, open the cmd for flask's server and select it, and press enter.
